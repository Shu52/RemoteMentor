# Remote Mentor
Policy for Remote Mentor for common tables

## Intro (Rough Draft)
For many students and mentors, it can be a hardship to meet at the school for the mentor common table. This policy is meant to remove the pain point of trying to connect mentor-student teams. 

### Getting started
(I will probably set up a new slack channel or reappropriate the ask-alumni channel)
Mentors will check in in slack channel when they are aviable. The student will contact the mentor through this channel to start an session. Slack can handle a voice call and we suggest the live share extention for VS code for screen share. Alternetly, teams can use google hangout and screen share but the resolution is worse to read code on and forces the team member to scroll for the other to read. One cautionary note with Live share. the student should use the read only link to avoid alumni take over.
