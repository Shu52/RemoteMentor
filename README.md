# Remote Mentor
Policy for Remote Mentor for common tables

## Intro (Rough Draft)
For many students and Alumni, it can be a hardship to meet at the school for the Alumni common table. This policy is meant to remove the pain point of trying to connect Alumni-student teams. 

### Getting started
(I will probably set up a new slack channel or reappropriate the ask-alumni channel)
Alumni will check in in slack channel when they are available. The student will contact the mentor through this channel to start an session. Slack can handle a voice call and we suggest the [live share extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) for VS code for screen share. Alternately, teams can use google hangout and screen share but the resolution is worse add makes code harder to read. It also forces the team member to scroll for the other to read. One cautionary note with Live share. the student should use the read only link to avoid alumni take over.

### Example workflow

*In Slack Channel*
```
*Shu:*Hey guys! I am available to answer questions from 4-7 today. I can help with React,Js, C# and .NET"
```
```
*Student:*I could use some help with React. I am working on my frontend project and the app doesn't route the user correctly after login.
```
The alumni will make the call when they are ready. Check volume and mic settings if needed.
```
*Shu:*I will call you through slack. Prepare to Direct Message me your Live share link
```
Alumni will click on student's name and select call. Student will answer call and slack out Live share link (read only) in direct message. Alumni may want to slack out in channel that they are with a student and are unavailable. Student will click on "LiveShare" link on bottom left of VS Code. A popup will appear on bottom right. Student should select "Make Read-Only" button and paste link into direct message to alumni in slack. 
After the session is over, student should stop the collaborating session in VS Code. The Alumni should make a slack message that they are now available.
